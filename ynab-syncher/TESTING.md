- **Graceful Failures**: Continues execution even if individual tests fail
- **Exit Codes**: Proper return codes for CI/CD integration
- **Debug Information**: Detailed output for troubleshooting

## 🏗️ What Each Test Category Validates

### Architecture Tests (ArchUnit)

- **Domain Independence**: No framework dependencies in domain layer
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Proper dependency directions
- **Package Organization**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Immutability**: Domain models are records without setters
- **Port & Adapter Compliance**: Interfaces in correct packages

### Unit Tests (Domain)

- **Business Logic**: All use cases and domain services
- **Value Objects**: Money, IDs, and domain entities
- **Domain Models**: BankTransaction, YnabTransaction behavior
- **Category Inference**: ML-based transaction categorization
- **Transaction Matching**: Reconciliation algorithms

### Integration Tests (Infrastructure)

- **External APIs**: YNAB API client with WireMock
- **HTTP Error Handling**: Proper exception mapping
- **JSON Serialization**: DTO mapping validation
- **Configuration**: Spring Boot integration
- **Adapter Patterns**: Infrastructure adapters

### Mutation Testing (PIT)

- **Test Quality**: Validates that tests actually test logic
- **Code Coverage**: Ensures comprehensive test coverage
- **Edge Cases**: Finds untested code paths
- **Mutation Score**: Target ≥70% (enterprise grade)
- **⚠️ Note**: Mutation scores can vary between runs due to randomization in mutation generation

## 🚀 Production Readiness Indicators

When all tests pass, the system demonstrates:

### ✅ **Hexagonal Architecture Compliance**

- Domain independence maintained (framework-free)
- Proper dependency direction enforcement
- Clean separation of concerns
- Port and adapter pattern compliance

### ✅ **Test Quality Metrics**

- Comprehensive unit test coverage (93%+ line coverage)
- Integration tests for all adapters
- Mutation testing validates test effectiveness (70%+ mutation score)
- Architecture tests prevent drift

### ✅ **Code Quality Validation**

- Domain models are immutable (records)
- No setters in domain layer
- Proper error handling and boundaries
- Production-ready configuration

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Mutation Testing Threshold Failures**

   ```bash
   # Mutation scores can vary between runs (66-80% range observed)
   # This is normal due to randomization in mutation generation
   mvn -pl domain org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage
   # Review HTML report in domain/target/pit-reports/
   # Focus on line coverage (should be 80%+) and test strength

   ```

2. **Architecture Test Failures**

   ```bash
   # Run specific architecture test
   mvn test -pl infrastructure -Dtest=ArchitectureTest
   # Check for dependency violations in output
   ```

3. **Integration Test Failures**
   ```bash
   # Check WireMock integration specifically
   mvn -pl infrastructure test -Dtest=YnabApiClientWireMockTest
   ```

### Manual Test Execution

You can also run individual test categories manually:

```bash
# Architecture tests only
mvn test -pl infrastructure -Dtest=ArchitectureTest

# Domain unit tests only
mvn -pl domain test

# Infrastructure integration tests only
mvn -pl infrastructure test

# Full build with all tests
mvn clean verify

# Mutation testing only (domain)
mvn -pl domain org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage

# Code coverage only
mvn clean test jacoco:report
```
